To work effectively with Django or Flask, you don’t need to master all of Python — but you do need a solid understanding of core Python concepts. Below is a practical list of Python topics you should learn first, categorized by priority:

✅ Minimum Python You Need for Django and Flask
1. Core Python (Must Know)
You should be comfortable with:

✅ Variables & Data Types (int, str, list, dict, tuple, set)

✅ Control Flow: if, else, elif

✅ Loops: for, while, break, continue

✅ Functions: def, return, default arguments

✅ String Operations: slicing, formatting, .split(), .join()

✅ List & Dictionary Comprehensions

✅ Error Handling: try, except, finally

✅ Basic File I/O: open(), read(), write()

2. Intermediate Python (Highly Recommended)
To write scalable, clean web apps:

✅ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):

Classes & Objects

__init__, self

Inheritance

@property, @classmethod, @staticmethod

✅ Modules & Packages: import, from ... import, __init__.py

✅ Virtual Environments: venv, pip

✅ Decorators: (especially useful in Flask & Django views/middleware)

✅ Lambda functions and map(), filter(), zip()

3. Advanced Topics (Optional but Useful)
